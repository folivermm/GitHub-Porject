# Grub Dash Website Backend

## Introduction

This repository sets up an API and builds out specific routes so that frontend developers can demo some initial design ideas.

## Features and Achievements

- Used common middleware packages
- Handled requests through routes
- Accessed relevant information through route parameters
- Built an API following RESTful design principles
- Implemented custom middleware functions

## Routes

- **GET /dishes:** Responds with a list of all existing dish data.

- **POST /dishes:** Saves a new dish and responds with the newly created dish.

- **GET /dishes/:dishId:** Responds with the dish where id === :dishId or returns 404 if no matching dish is found.

- **PUT /dishes/:dishId:** Updates the dish where id === :dishId or returns 404 if no matching dish is found.

- **GET /orders:** Responds with a list of all existing order data.

- **POST /orders:** Saves a new order and responds with the newly created order.

- **GET /orders/:orderId:** Responds with the order where id === :orderId or returns 404 if no matching order is found.

- **PUT /orders/:orderId:** Updates the order where id === :orderId or returns 404 if no matching order is found.

- **DELETE /orders/:orderId:** Deletes the order where id === :orderId.

- **Validation middleware:**
